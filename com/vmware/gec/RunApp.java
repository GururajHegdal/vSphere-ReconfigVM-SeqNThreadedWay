/**
 * Utility program to reconfigure VM (Serial & multi threaded way).
 *
 * Serial way:
 * Retrieves all VMs in inventory and perform sequential VM reconfiguration operation.
 *
 * Multi Threaded way:
 * Retrieves all Hosts in inventory. From each host, all registered VMs are retrieved and
 * reconfiguration operation on all VMs is done in parallel (Multi-Threaded manner).
 * Once done, next host in the list would be picked up, for reconfiguring its registered VMs.
 *
 * VM Reconfiguration operation :
 * Itâ€™s just a plain reconfigure VM operation without any changes pushed to the VM.
 * Empty VM config spec is created and applied to VM- which does not affect the source vm configuration.
 * Based on the need or requirement, the VM config spec can be tweaked to apply specific changes on VM(s).
